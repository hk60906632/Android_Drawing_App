<h1>Feedback on Graphics assignment</h1>

<p></p>

<p>You've produced a very good android drawing app. It is reasonably well designed,
and you've learned a lot from it.
</p>

<p><ul>
<li>Mark for development skills 14/20</li>
<li>Mark for technical skills 28/40</li>
<li>Mark for creativity 28/40</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p></p>

<h2>General feedback</h2>

<p>I gave marks out of 20, 40, 40 for development, technical and creative
issues.</p>

<p>The development mark is for showing that you've learned something from the
unit. So, it is for having multiple classes, showing a sense of design, and
getting a whole program together and working, possibly using an IDE or other
tools.</p>

<p>The technical mark is for exploring graphics in some direction or other, and
showing off some sophistication.  This might be in animation, or user
interaction, or special library features, or integrating graphics with some
other logic.</p>

<p>The creativity mark is for interesting ideas, or twists on old ideas, or
technical exploration of possibilities, or polish, or artistic flair, or
anything else that impressed me.</p>

<p>For many of you, your model is closely associated with graphics, making
testing difficult. That is OK for an assignment of this size, and I wasn't picky
about it in the marking. But it is important to remember that in larger
projects, just because you have a GUI, that's no excuse for ignoring best
practices. You need small or smallish classes, with tiny methods, total
robustness, low dependencies, and plenty of automatic testing. Graphics
libraries tend to force your design in a particular direction, but it is up to
you to decide who is in control. So make this a priority for the next project
you do that involves graphics.</p>

<p>Take Tetris for example, which several of you implemented. Maybe you got the
logic from a tutorial. If so, you probably need more practice in developing
logic without a tutorial. If not, the logic is sufficiently complex to need
independent, automatic testing. If I was implementing Tetris, my graphical view
component would draw a grid of coloured squares, nothing else. It would know
nothing about pieces or their shapes or their movements or the progress of the
game. After each time step, the view would ask the model what colour to draw
each square. That's all. The model would deal with all the logic, using a grid
of characters or other symbols, and have no dependency whatsoever on graphics
library classes. In fact, to avoid being influenced by the graphics library, I
would write the model first, with automatic testing, and with text printout for
interactive testing, before adding a GUI.</p>
